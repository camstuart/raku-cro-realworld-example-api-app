This repo is work in progress â€” PRs and issues welcome!

## The Story So Far

This is an application stub generated by `cro stub`.  To try it out,
you'll need to have Cro installed; you can do so using:

```
zef install --/test cro
```

Then change directory to the app root (the directory containing this
`README.md` file), and run these commands:

```
zef install --depsonly .
cro run
```

To run tests:

```
raku -I lib t/*
```

You can also build and run a docker image while in the app root using:

```
docker build -t realworld-api .
docker run --rm -p 10000:10000 realworld-api
```
